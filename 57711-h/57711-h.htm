<h1 title="">HUDSON TERCENTENARY</h1>
<p>Let us turn back the pages of history and take
a cursory view of what gave the wonderful stimulus
to maritime adventure; and what so long
delayed the discovery of the western world by the
Europeans.</p>
<p>Civilized mankind scarcely secures the <i>necessaries</i>
of life before the desire for the <i>luxuries</i>
springs up and is cherished.</p>
<p>For untold centuries all of eastern Asia forbade
the entrance of foreigners into its territories. To
Europeans it was an unknown land.</p>
<p>In the year 326 B. C. Alexander the Great
marched his conquering Macedonian legions
against the myriads of Asiatic troops, subdued
them and marched on to the Hindus, where he
&ldquo;improvised a fleet&rdquo; for his army, sailed down
that river, called Sacred, to the Indian ocean.
Astonished at the wealth of the country and having
amassed precious gems and hundreds of
millions of dollars he returned loaded with his
treasures up the Euphrates, to that most wonderful
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
city of ancient times, Babylon, where he died.
He opened the western doors of India, which
exposed its great wealth, excited the avarice of
the small number of Greeks who knew of his
exploits; and for centuries it was the Europeans&rsquo;
Eldorado, which ultimately, by its luxury and
effeminacy, undermined western manhood and led
to the decay of Greece and Rome.</p>
<p>Asia, beyond the Euphrates, except by a few,
was an unknown country to Europeans until
Marco Polo in 1271 A. D., in the company of his
father and uncle, met Kublai Khan, the Mongol
Emperor, won his confidence and esteem and by
him was entrusted with the most important missions.
During the seventeen years he remained
he visited the most important places in China,
India and the East Indies, and returned to Italy
loaded with the rarest, most precious gems and
immense wealth, published a book telling his
experience and picturing the East in the most
roseate colors, generally emanating from fancy,
but in this case resting upon facts of which he
was able to furnish satisfactory proof.</p>
<p>The fact established that India&mdash;the East
Indies had the gold, silver, precious gems and
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
stones, ebony, ivory, cloves, cinnamon, cassia,
spices and the most beautiful and costly fabrics,
articles not obtainable elsewhere and the great
desiderata of the Europeans, the question arose
as to how they could the most easily, quickly and
cheaply be obtained. They could, without much
difficulty, find their way to the Indian ocean, but
the transportation thence to Europe must be by
&ldquo;the ship of the desert,&rdquo; the camel, across the
Arabian desert and the Isthmus of Suez, &ldquo;the
bridge of nations&rdquo; to the Mediterranean or by a
more northerly route through the Caspian and
Black seas. Caravans must be formed by the
merchants and armed troops to protect them
against the robbers. The land route by the caravans
was slow and very expensive, and the hope
was cherished that an all-water route might be
found which would not only shorten the time, but
greatly lessen the expense of transportation. For
a considerable time the Ph&oelig;nicians, occupying a
little skirt of land on the eastern end of the
Mediterranean, and the first distinctly commercial
nation in the world&rsquo;s history, virtually monopolized
this land transportation; and then distributed
the articles along the shore of the Mediterranean,
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
where they had planted colonies clear up to the
Pillars of Hercules. But Venice and Genoa, rival
and wealthy cities of Italy, with fine harbors on
this inland sea, sought the India trade, supplanted
Ph&oelig;nicia and became greatly enriched by it. The
great desideratum&mdash;an all-water route from western
Europe to the Indies&mdash;had not yet been found,
but after the Italian cities had enjoyed, monopolized
the trade with India for a period of 150
years, another little skirt of land on the west end
of the Mediterranean and on the Atlantic ocean,
Portugal, brought about a complete change in the
transportation which deprived Venice and Genoa
of that business.</p>
<p>Henry, Prince of Portugal, surnamed the Navigator,
far in advance of his time in geographical
knowledge and in the science of navigation, introduced
the compass and the astrolabe, which he
furnished with nautical maps and other guides for
his mariners, whom he inspired to sail along the
western coast of Africa and double the Cape of
Good Hope. This, Bartholomew Diaz, a Portuguese
navigator, did in 1486, and then it seemed
certain that an all-water route from western
Europe to India had been found, but it was not
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
an accomplished fact until Vasco da Gama, a
Portuguese navigator, availing himself of Diaz&rsquo;s
discovery of 1486, made a voyage in 1497 from
Lisbon to Calicut (not Calcutta) in southwestern
India.</p>
<p>Henry &ldquo;the Navigator&rdquo; was the father of what
may be called ocean, in contradistinction to coast,
navigation, scientific, instead of chance navigation,
although he died before the Cape of Good Hope
had been doubled. After Diaz had doubled the
Cape of Good Hope in 1486, the furor of every
mariner was to point the prow of his vessel
toward India to share in its precious gems, its
beautiful and costly fabrics, articles of luxury,
and its great wealth. The India fever seized all
the maritime nations of Europe, Portugal, Spain,
France, the Netherlands, England, Sweden and
Denmark. Christopher Columbus in 1492 sought,
and thought he had found India by sailing westward.
Then Rodrigo Lenzoli Borgia, a Spaniard,
and the Pope, under the title of Alexander VI,
assuming to be vice-gerent of the world, made a
division of all the newly-discovered, or subsequently
to be discovered, heathen lands between
the two great Catholic powers, Spain and Portugal,
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
by drawing a line from pole to pole one hundred
leagues west of the Azores and the Cape de
Verde islands (this line was subsequently changed)
and declared that all lands discovered west of that
line and not belonging to some Christian prince
should belong to Spain, and all similar lands east
of that line should belong to Portugal. The two
great maritime and exploring nations of the fifteenth
and sixteenth centuries were Portugal and
Spain&mdash;the former in the east and the latter in
the west. Alas! their great fame is in the past.
Spain hoped to reach the Indies by a shorter all-water
route, sailing <i>westward</i>, and that was
Columbus&rsquo;s mission, purpose and hope.</p>
<p>The edict of the Pope did not, in the least,
restrain France, England or the Netherlands from
attempting to make discoveries, and France, England,
the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark
granted charters to companies of their own subjects,
granting them great and exclusive rights,
and calling them East India companies. At the
close of the year A. D. 1600, Queen Elizabeth chartered
the English East India Company with most
extraordinary rights and privileges, and thus laid
the foundations for Great Britain&rsquo;s Asiatic
empire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>The Dutch East India Company charter was
granted in 1602, to trade to the East Indies by the
Cape of Good Hope and the Strait of Magellan
for twenty-one years, and no other of the East
India companies has been so successfully managed.
The Dutch have derived large revenue from
the islands they still hold there, viz.: Java, the
Moluccas or Spice islands, a large part of Borneo,
Sumatra, Celebes and several small islands in
the Malay Archipelago.</p>
<p>Cornelius Hartman, a Dutch navigator, who had
spent some time in Lisbon, Portugal, returned in
1594 to Amsterdam, where he gave such a glowing
account of the rich and wonderful products of the
East, which covered the quays of the Tagus, in
Lisbon, that nine prominent merchants of Amsterdam
formed a company, equipped a fleet of four
ships, fitted for war (a war then prevailing between
Holland and Spain) and for trade, and put
Hartman in command. He followed the Portuguese
route, and two years later returned with
cargoes far surpassing the expectations or even
the hopes of the company.</p>
<p>Seeing this Indian wealth upon their own docks,
other associations and companies were formed in
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
the Netherlands to engage in this lucrative trade.
Rivalry between them became so great as to diminish
the profits that a consolidation of the companies
was effected by Barneveldt. This company
consisted of six branches called chambers, each
of which was to be managed by its own directors
(originally fifty-three in all) in different parts of
the country.</p>
<p>A general council of seventeen directors (Amsterdam
eight, Zealand four, Rotterdam, Hoorn
and Enkhuizen each one, and the seventeenth to be
chosen by the chamber of Zealand, the Maas and
North Holland) were by a majority of votes to
<i>determine all voyages</i>. This arrangement was
made to protect the small chambers against the
power and policy of Amsterdam if against their
interests. Each locality was secured in its due
proportion of the business of the company. Each
chamber had the exclusive management of its ships
sent out by it and was held responsible for the
property coming into its possession. The general
council of seventeen did not meet often, but the
subordinate chambers could legislate upon subjects
appropriate, and which did not trench upon the
general policy and course of the company.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>The Dutch East India Company was clothed
with extraordinary powers and privileges and
became very wealthy; not alone in the pursuit of
the East India trade, but by capturing in the West
Indies galleons containing great quantities of gold
and silver, which the Spaniards, by the most cruel
methods, had taken in Mexico and Peru.</p>
<p>The ancients held different opinions about the
form, dimensions, the proportion of land to water,
of the earth, and as to whether it was motionless,
around which all the universe revolved, as the
great center, and of supreme importance, or
whether it was merely a satellite revolving around
the sun. It seems flat and the heavenly bodies
seem to revolve around it. Others thought the
earth was a sphere because &ldquo;the sphere is the
most perfect form; it was the center of the universe
because that is the place of honor; and it is
motionless, because motion is less dignified than
rest.&rdquo; Some believed that the earth is round and
rests upon the ocean. Homer (900 B. C.) taught
that the earth is flat, and so, too, did some of the
learned men of Greece and Rome, in the Augustan
age. The great Church of Rome, of unequaled
influence and power, taught that the earth is flat
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
and the center of the universe and interdicted, and
for centuries punished as heretics, those denying
the infallibility of the Popes and teaching otherwise.
It is probable that about 600 B. C., Thales
of Miletus, one of the &ldquo;Seven Wise Men of
Greece,&rdquo; a famous astronomer and geometer, was
the first to teach that the earth is round. About
550 B. C. Pythagoras, the renowned Greek philosopher
and mathematician, taught that &ldquo;the
earth is a globe which admits of antipodes; that
it is in motion; is not the center of the universe,
but revolves around the sun.&rdquo; Plato, Aristotle,
Hipparchus, Pliny, Cicero, Virgil, Ovid, Eratosthenes
and many others, the most eminent scholars
of their times, believed that the earth is a
sphere; and Eratosthenes, an Alexandrian philosopher,
astronomer, geometer and geographer
about 210 B. C. thought that he had not only
proved that by scientific astronomical observations
but also the speed of the earth in its revolutions;
its magnitude and also the relative proportion of
its constituent elements of land and water.</p>
<p>Claudius Ptolemy, about 150 A. D., a celebrated
Alexandrian astronomer, geographer and mathematician,
held the opinion and promulgated it,
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
that the earth is a sphere and that the sun, planets
and stars revolve around it as the grand center.
He was the founder of the Ptolemaic System which
was almost universally received for 1,350 years,
when the system of Copernicus (a revival of the
system of Pythagoras) permanently displaced it,
notwithstanding the violent opposition, extending
to persecution, of the Church of Rome against it.</p>
<p>Claudius Ptolemy had calculated the equatorial
girth of the earth to be 20,400 miles. Making
allowance for latitude, the circumference at the
Canaries would be about 18,000 miles and the
diameter about one-third of that, or 6,000 miles.
Columbus was a student of everything accessible
concerning geography and navigation and a devout
Roman Catholic. He credited the statement in the
Apochrypha of the Bible, Second Esdras, chapter
6, verse 42, which says: &ldquo;Upon the third day
Thou didst command that the <i>waters</i> should be
gathered in the <i>seventh part of the earth</i>, six parts
has Thou dried up and kept them,&rdquo; etc., etc.</p>
<p>If Ptolemy&rsquo;s calculation had been correct and
Esdras&rsquo;s statement reliable, 18,000 miles divided
by 7, giving a quotient of 2,571 miles, would have
been the distance Columbus would have had to
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
sail from the Azores to Japan. He estimated he
might have to sail 4,000 miles (to reach the west
coast of India facing Europe) by being deflected
from a straight course. The real distance from
the Canaries to Japan is 12,000 miles, and the
relative proportion of salt water on the surface
of the earth to the land is <i>three-quarters</i>. Columbus,
believing that he was inspired and commissioned
by God to convert the heathen, sailed and
thought he had reached India, called the natives
Indians (so they have been called ever since) and
he died so thinking.</p>
<p>If the magnitude of the earth&mdash;its diameter
had been ascertained and the relative proportion
of land to water with the known longitude and
latitude of India, then the problem was easily
solved that an all-water route to India from
Europe, whether by sailing westward or northward,
would greatly diminish the distance (about
8,000 miles) covered by sailing around Cape Good
Hope. That was a great desideratum&mdash;the aim
of individuals and nations, which would seem to
warrant the belief of speedy accomplishment. Let
us not forget that we must consider the conditions
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
of the past and not of the twentieth or nineteenth
centuries.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding &ldquo;Henry, the Navigator&rdquo; applied
the inventions and equipments so indispensable
to scientific navigation, and did all he could
to inspire his sailors to sail around South Africa,
it was forty years before that was an accomplished
fact. So inferior, so inadequate, for ocean navigation,
were the vessels then, and so little was known
about ocean currents and the trade winds, that we
can easily imagine that long sea voyages were
discouraging.</p>
<p>There is no other class of men so superstitious
as were the sailors, nor as are the sailors now.
Everything that they see or hear of, that is
unusual or they don&rsquo;t understand, frightens them
as foreboding evil. It is an experience reported
by so many of the famous navigators. You will
recall Columbus&rsquo;s experience in his first voyage
across the Atlantic, and not only the evasive
answers he gave when the sailors noticed a variation
of the needle and his threats to enforce his
orders, that he might continue his voyage.</p>
<p>About 480 B. C., Pindar, the greatest of the
lyric poets of Greece, declared that &ldquo;Beyond
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
Cades (Cadiz in Spain) no man, however bold and
brave, could pass; only a god might voyage those
waters.&rdquo; The Atlantic was deemed a dangerous
ocean. Thus we are reminded of some of the
obstacles which delayed European discovery of the
western world.</p>
<p>All that is known of the life, education, pursuits
and achievements of Hudson, the Navigator, whose
name is perpetuated in monuments (&ldquo;more enduring
than brass&rdquo;) upon the face of nature (its
waters and land) in North America, is contained
in the brief period of five years, or from 1606 to
1611, and is almost entirely contained in his log-books
of his four voyages.</p>
<p>That so little about Hudson is known is not
because efforts have not been made by competent
and zealous investigators. It is greatly to be
regretted that Richard Hakluyt and Samuel Purchas,
Englishmen and contemporaries of Hudson,
so greatly condensed in their writings the material
they had and which is the chief source of information.</p>
<p>Hessel Gerritsz and Emanuel Van Meteren,
Hollanders, also contemporaries of Hudson, historians,
geographers, map-makers and publishers,
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
threw much side-light upon the discoveries which
had been made in search of an all-water route to
India (describing and illustrating by maps) before
Hudson made any of his four famous voyages.</p>
<p>Coming down to the nineteenth century we find
prominent among Hudson&rsquo;s biographers, Henry
R. Cleveland&rsquo;s Life of Hudson, in Sparks&rsquo; Library
of American Biography, vol. 10, 1838; Henry
Hudson in Holland, by the Hon. Henry C. Murphy,
United States Minister at The Hague in 1859; Gen.
John Meredith Read, Jr.&rsquo;s elaborate historical
research about Hudson published in 1866; Dr.
G. M. Asher&rsquo;s article on Henry Hudson, printed
for the Hakluyt Society in London, 1860; and John
Knox Laughton, Professor of Modern History in
Kings College since 1885, whose article appears
in the Dictionary of International Biography,
vol. 28, pp. 147-149, stating that Dr. Asher&rsquo;s article
of 400 pages covers almost everything known
about Henry Hudson, and Justin Winsor&rsquo;s
America, eight volumes, in 1889; John Brodhead&rsquo;s
History of New York, 1871, etc., etc.</p>
<p><i>We do know that Hudson, the Navigator&rsquo;s name
was Henry and not Hendrick</i>, as so often called
and even now blazoned on the newest and finest
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
steamboat on the Hudson river, as evidenced in
his contract with the Amsterdam directors of the
Dutch East India Company, a copy of which
follows. <i>We know that he was and remained an
Englishman when on his return from his third
voyage</i> (for the Dutch) the English government
forbade him and all the Englishmen with him to
enter any service other than for her own country.</p>
<p>As Hudson did not understand the Dutch language
he employed, as his interpreter in his conference
with the two Amsterdam directors of the
Dutch East India Company, a learned Hollander
named Jodocus Hondius, who signed the contract
as a witness.</p>
<p class="tbcenter">CONTRACT.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On this eighth day of January in the year of
our Lord 1609, the directors of the East India
Company of the Chamber of Amsterdam, of the
ten year&rsquo;s reckoning of the one part, and Mr
Henry Hudson, Englishman assisted by Jodocus
Hondius of the other part have agreed in manner
following, to wit: That the said directors shall
in the first place equip a small vessel or yacht of
about thirty lasts (about 60 tons) burden with
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
which well provided with men, provisions, and
other necessaries the aforesaid Hudson shall about
the first of April sail in order to search for a
passage by the North, around by the North side
of Novaya Zemlya and shall continue thus along
that parallel until he shall be able to sail southward
to the latitude of 60 degrees. He shall
obtain as much knowledge of the lands as can be
done without any considerable loss of time, and
if it be possible return immediately, in order to
make a faithful report and relation of his voyage
to the directors, and to deliver over his journals,
log books and charts together with an account of
everything whatsoever which shall happen to him
during the voyage, without keeping anything back;
for which said voyage the directors shall pay to
the said Hudson as well as for his outfit for the
said voyage as for the support of his wife and
children the sum of 800 guilders; (about 320 dollars)
and, in case (which God prevent) he do not
come back or arrive hereabouts within a year the
directors shall further pay to his wife 200 guilders
in cash; and thereupon they shall not be further
liable to him or his heirs, unless he shall either
afterward or within the year arrive and have
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
found the passage good and suitable for the company
to use; in which case the directors will
reward the aforenamed Hudson for his dangers,
trouble and knowledge in their discretion, with
which the before mentioned Hudson is content. And
in case the directors think proper to prosecute and
continue the same voyage it is stipulated and
agreed with the aforenamed Hudson that he shall
make his residence in this country with his wife
and children, and shall enter into the employment
of no other than the Company and this at the discretion
of the directors, who also promise to make
him satisfied and content for such further service
in all justice and equity. All without fraud or
evil intent. In witness of the truth, two contracts
are made hereof, of the same tenor and are subscribed
by both parties and also by Jodocus Hondius
as interpreter and witness.</p>

<p>The period of the tercentenary of Henry Hudson&rsquo;s
exploration, in 1609, of the &ldquo;Grande river,&rdquo;
which for centuries has been called the &ldquo;Hudson
river,&rdquo; approaches, and already plans and preparations,
on a grand scale, have been begun to commemorate
that highly important event.</p>
<p>Albanians are especially interested and participating
in the preparations for this celebration,
for the site of Albany was deemed the most important
in the New Netherlands, that of the city
of New York alone excepted, and in many respects,
early, even more important than that. For at
Albany, near the confluence of the two great rivers
of the territory of New York, the Hudson from
the north and the Mohawk from the west, the
Indians from the north and west came in their
canoes with their peltry and furs, as a market
place, designed by nature, for the exchange of
articles between the red men and the white men
for what they did not want, to get what, respectively,
they did want. Then, too, it was where the
Indians assembled to make their important
treaties; where the governors of the American
provinces met to consider and decide important
measures; and where the first provincial congress,
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
in 1754, met and prepared a plan for the union of
the colonies. It was, moreover, the great strategic
point contended for by the French and English
on American soil, and later by the English against
the United States in the War of the American
Revolution. Albany&rsquo;s charter, as a city, under
the date of 1686, is the oldest unrevoked charter
of a city in the United States and during the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries no place in
the western world surpassed it in historic interest;
and for the last hundred years and more, as the
capital of the Empire State, it has been considered,
next to Washington, the most influential
and important legislative center in the United
States.</p>
<p>The Scandinavians were the earliest and boldest
Arctic navigators and Iceland was their rendezvous.
A great part of the Arctic shores that
have been visited in modern times was known to
the Scandinavians.</p>
<p>Columbus visited Iceland fifteen years before
he sailed in 1492. S. Cabot went to North America
in 1498 by way of Iceland. Scandinavians were
seeking fisheries, as were the exploring nations of
that period, and many of their acts were those of
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
freebooters. The Portuguese, the Spanish, and
the French, the three nations which had followed
in the track of Cabot and his English companions
and had then arrived at the northern shores of
America in search of a passage to Asia, did not
abandon the newly explored region.</p>
<p>The Portuguese continued their surveys of the
northern coasts most likely to discover advantageous
fisheries. They advanced slowly along
the shores of Newfoundland and then up to the
mouth of Hudson strait, then through that strait,
and at last into <i>Hudson bay</i>. With a certain number
of ancient maps, ranging from 1529 to 1570,
before us we can trace the progress step by step.
In 1554 the Portuguese seemed not yet to have
reached the mouth of the Hudson strait. In 1558
their geographical knowledge extended beyond the
mouth of the strait and in 1570 they had reached
the bay. The authorities for all this are our
ancient geographical delineations. Much geographical
intelligence in those days was kept
secret. <i>We can therefore state with the greatest
certainty that Hudson bay had been discovered
before the publication of Ortelius&rsquo;s Atlas, published
1570. So said Dr. Asher.</i></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>General J. M. Read, Jr., with competent assistants,
much time and ample means, pursued a
thorough, exhaustive examination to ascertain all
possible about the Hudsons, of which Henry was
one; and while the book is very interesting and
many ingenious theories presented, yet rock-foundation
of evidence seems to be lacking.</p>
<p>While neither the parents of Henry Hudson nor
the date of his birth have been ascertained, that
he was born in England, and almost beyond question
in Hoddersdon (where so many of the Hudsons
lived) in Hertfordshire, about seventeen
miles north by east of London, seems settled. It,
moreover, seems highly probable that our Henry
Hudson was the grandson of Henry Hudson, a
Londoner of great wealth and influence, one of
the founders and the first president of the Muscovy
or Russian Company which Sebastian Cabot
suggested and of which he became its first governor,
and that in the service of that company our
navigator there had his first service and won the
rank and distinction of captain. The Muscovy or
Russian Company was formed of London merchant
adventurers for the purpose of seeking an
all-water route to the Indies by sailing north of
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
Russia and then down the Pacific, greatly shortening
the route via the Cape of Good Hope. This
company was held in such high esteem that both
England and Russia granted it a charter in 1555.
Several unsuccessful voyages for this purpose
were made, the ice and storms proving insurmountable
obstacles. It was in the employ of this company
where, and in his own journal, our Henry
Hudson first makes himself known as the captain
of the &ldquo;Hopeful,&rdquo; which sailed April 19, 1607,
with ten sailors and his son John, a boy, aboard,
with directions to explore the coast of Greenland,
pass around it to the northeast, or directly under
the Pole or, in his own words, &ldquo;for to discover
a passage by the North Pole to Japan and China.&rdquo;
The &ldquo;Hopeful&rdquo; left Gravesend May 1, 1607, and
in twenty-six days reached the Shetland Islands,
where supplies were taken on. Four days after
leaving these islands it was observed that the magnetic
needle was deflected, which created consternation
among the sailors. They believed the
voyage was under an evil spell and would meet
with disaster. Then the resources of the captain
were evoked to carry out instructions or plans
and prevent mutiny. Hudson managed his crew,
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
sailed along the east coast of Greenland and
thence along the ice barrier to Spitzbergen (discovered
by the Dutch in 1596), going as far north
as 80&deg; 23&prime;. Prevented by ice, he sailed back to
England, which he reached September 15, 1607.</p>
<p>The Muscovy Company still believed that an
all-water and a very much shorter route than that
via Cape of Good Hope from Western Europe to
India could be found by the northeast, fitted out
a vessel with a larger crew and gave our Captain
Henry Hudson the command of it and under the
same instructions as before. His son, as well as
several others of his crew on the &ldquo;Hopeful,&rdquo;
went with him on this second voyage. He sailed
from London April 25, 1608, and, obstructed by
the ice, he could go no further than Nova Zembla,
which had been discovered in 1553. He promptly
returned to England and reported to the company.
Hudson asked for more men and less rigid orders
that he might make another voyage, but the company
did not comply with his request. &ldquo;It is
not known whether it was because it had abandoned
the hope of finding a northeastern route
or had lost confidence in Hudson&rsquo;s ability.&rdquo;
Navigators, like prophets, &ldquo;are not without honor
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
save in their own country;&rdquo; as examples, Columbus,
John Cabot, Verazzano, Magellan and
Americus Vespucius, whose discoveries were for
nations not their own.</p>
<p>Hudson, firm in the belief that he could find a
much shorter all-water route than then was
known, sought employment from the Dutch East
India Company, which had heard of him as an
able, brave and skilled navigator who had been
in the employ of their rival&mdash;the English&mdash;an
incentive to secure his services. Hudson was
invited to Amsterdam to confer with the directors
of the Dutch East India Company. He went
and there met the Amsterdam directors of the
Dutch East India Company. The Amsterdam
directors thought favorably of securing Hudson&rsquo;s
services for the Dutch East India Company&mdash;at
all events to prevent him from entering any
other service and it is said they asked him to come
to them a year later for employment as a matter
of that importance could be acted on only by
the Council of Seventeen. This was to postpone
the matter, much to Hudson&rsquo;s disappointment and
detriment&mdash;ending, possibly, in mere talk. The
Dutch East India Company was then the most
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
prosperous of the East India companies and was
really more anxious to prevent any other company
from discovering a new all-water route (<i>the company
had resolved to do that at any cost</i>) than to
find one themselves. However, the Amsterdam
directors did not hoodwink Hudson by their excuse
for delay, which would bind him for a year and
leave them free. A former director of the Dutch
East India Company, who thought he had been
ill treated by the company, resigned, became a
bitter opponent of the company and resided in
Paris. He told Hudson of the duplicity and purpose
of the Amsterdam directors in holding him
in suspense. The then French King, Henry IV,
felt chagrined that France, through oversight or
neglect, had not in any due proportion, considering
her dignity and importance, shared in the
India trade and that her expeditions to Canada
had not proved a success, determined to seek and
obtain an experienced navigator to take command
of a well-equipped expedition in quest of the best
all-water route to India. The French King was
advised to communicate with James Lemaire, a
Dutch navigator of great wealth and residing in
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
Paris. He did so and Lemaire knew Hudson and
named him as the best man for the position.</p>
<p>Governments employ a secret service to keep
a close watch upon other governments and to
report promptly what they are doing and contemplating.
King Henry learned about Henry
Hudson&rsquo;s conference with the Amsterdam directors
of the Dutch East India Company who wanted
to bind him to wait a year before engaging again
in a voyage of discovery for India and then come
to them for employment.</p>
<p>The French King gave orders that Hudson be
engaged at once on most liberal terms in the service
of France, but the Amsterdam directors
learned of his decision and without any further
delay entered on the 8th of January, 1609, in a
contract with Hudson which resulted in the Dutch
claim of New Netherlands instead, perhaps, of
extended French claims in the New World. This
contract has been very sharply commented upon
as being very illiberal in the compensation stated
for the services and great risk that Hudson was
to undergo; that while clear in terms it was not
in perfect good faith for as it claimed to be an
act of the Dutch East India Company and was
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
signed by <i>only two of the directors of the Amsterdam
chamber who had no authority to bind the
company in such a matter and that therefore it
was voidable if for any reason the company so
desired</i>. It might have been merely an inexpensive
scheme to prevent Hudson from entering
any other employ. Then, too, it appeared singular
that either the Amsterdam directors or Hudson
should want to attempt the <i>northeastern</i> route
which so often had resulted in failure before our
Hudson&rsquo;s time and that Hudson himself as a
master had signally failed in two expeditions and
probably before that while as a mariner in the
employ of the Muscovy Company. It seemed as
though Hudson who, after commanding two
searches for the Muscovy Company wanted
greater freedom in the pursuit and so asked of
that company. The belief on the part of some
was that there was a secret agreement or understanding
between the contracting parties that
Hudson might, or was really, to ignore the contract
which was given to the public as a blind.
While subsequent events gave color, plausibility
to these thoughts, they were merely conjectures,
for it is most remarkable that there has so little
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
documentary evidence been found about a man
whose name appears so often and so prominently
in North America. Hudson&rsquo;s last voyage was for
three wealthy Englishmen, viz.: Sir Thomas
Smythe, Sir Dudley Digges and John Wolstenholme.
Doubtless very much of Hudson&rsquo;s writings
were not made public&mdash;probably publication
at that time was forbidden, fearing that rival
navigators would thereby gain some information
to their advantage and to the detriment of Hudson&rsquo;s
employers. Then, too, it has been thought
and said that if Hudson&rsquo;s writings had been published
in full some things would have been
revealed that at least some of the contracting
parties were anxious to conceal. Although nearly
300 years have passed and the public has not been
fully enlightened on this subject there still
remains the belief that Hudson&rsquo;s writings about
his contracts for searching for an all-water and
shorter route to India will yet be discovered and
published. To engage in any great and hazardous
undertaking there must be some adequate motive.
Considering the high demands and promises made
to bold and skillful navigators (perhaps in compensation,
rank, and authority none comparable
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
with the case of Christopher Columbus) it is
scarcely presumable that Henry Hudson entered
the service of the Dutch East India Company
merely for the paltry sum named in that contract
and in a route which he himself on two occasions
or more had found impracticable&mdash;presumably
impossible. Henry Hudson, a bold and experienced
navigator, well posted in the discoveries
made by maritime discoverers especially in the
New World; in the discoveries in geography,
geometry, and in possession of the latest and best
maps of the world, surely had some strong motive,
presumably a worthy ambition to become a discoverer
of a new all-water route to India, and in
his journal he told of his desire to seek that route
by sailing <i>westward</i> when his instructions were
distinct and positive to sail <i>north</i> and <i>east</i>.</p>
<p>If, then, such were the views and purposes of
Hudson when he made the contract (which is
quoted herein) with the Amsterdam directors of
the Dutch East India Company, let us see, if we
may, the real and principal motives actuating that
company, so powerful, so dominant in the Netherlands,
to engage Hudson by contract and whether
either party was not going to live up to it in good
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
faith or whether the strong presumption is that
it was merely a blind to deceive rivals and that
there was another and very different secret
agreement.</p>
<p>Charles V, German Emperor, was born at
Ghent, Flanders, 1500. He was the eldest son of
Philip, Archduke of Austria, and of Joanna, the
daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain.
Philip&rsquo;s parents were the Emperor Maximilian
and Marie, daughter and heiress of Charles the
Bold, Duke of Burgundy. On the death of his
grandfather, Ferdinand, in 1516, Charles took
possession of the throne of Spain by the title of
Charles I.</p>
<p>On the death of Maximilian in 1519 Charles
was elected German Emperor and crowned
October 22, 1519, at Aix-la-Chapelle and received
from the Pope the title of Roman Emperor,
making him the most powerful monarch in
Europe. A zealous Catholic, he aimed to nullify
the doctrine taught by the reformer Martin
Luther and to compel the Hollanders, the Netherlanders,
to express their faith and belief in
Ignatius Loyola, the reputed founder of the
Society of Jesus&mdash;the Jesuits. It was not
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
Loyola but Torquemada, whose name, as the
Chief Inquisitor, became a by-word and reproach.
Justin Winsor, a high authority, said that Carlyle
said, &ldquo;Those Dutch are a strong people. They
raised their land out of a marsh and went on for
a long time breeding cows and making cheese and
might have gone with their cows and cheese till
doomsday. But Spain comes over and says, &lsquo;We
want you to believe in Ignatius.&rsquo; The Dutch
replied, &lsquo;We are very sorry, but we cannot.&rsquo;
&lsquo;God, but you must,&rsquo; said Spain, and went about
it with guns and swords to make the Dutch believe
in Ignatius.&rdquo; Thus began a religious war (usually
the fiercest and most unrelenting) which, with
some cessation of hostilities, lasted for nearly
seventy years, down to 1648, when the independence
of the Dutch Republic was acknowledged
and it had become one of the foremost, if not
really the foremost, power in Europe.</p>
<p>War (which Erasmus called &ldquo;the malady of
princes&rdquo; and General Sherman called &ldquo;hell&rdquo;),
begun by Charles I of Spain against the Netherlands,
was continued by his son and grandson and
resulted in driving out of Europe many of North
America&rsquo;s early and most desirable settlers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>Many of the Dutch East India Company&rsquo;s vessels
were equipped for war as well as for commerce
and her East India possessions were active
in building and fitting out ships which captured
many and rich prizes from the Spaniards. The
richest locality for capturing such prizes was in
the West Indies, and what the Netherlands greatly
needed was territory near there, where her ships
could be sheltered, repaired, and obtain the needed
supplies. Spain was in possession of nearly all
of what is now the south of the United States, and
France of Canada. The English held Virginia
and claimed what is now called New England, but
between the two was a territory that seemed free
for settlement and there is reason to believe that
the Dutch East India Company was aware of that
fact and aimed to take it.</p>
<p>In 1497 and 1498 the Cabots, in the employ of
Henry VII of England, sailed westward in search
of a shorter all-water route to India, coasting
along the Atlantic from a parallel of latitude
about the same as that of the Straits of Gibraltar
clear up to Hudson straits, where the icebergs
prevented further advance. Having landed and
planted the English flag, they claimed the country
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
for the British crown and under their discovery
the English claim in North America rested. On
a German map made in 1515 America is represented
as a large island in the western Atlantic.
Magellan, in whose honor the straits near Cape
Horn, South America, were named, sailed around
the globe in 1519-21, proved that America was a
continent and the world a sphere. Sir Francis
Drake, in 1577-79, also circumnavigated the globe.
In 1728 Vitus Behring sailed through the straits
which bear his name and proved that America is
no part of Asia. From 1499 to 1504 Americus
Vespucius, a Florentine navigator and explorer,
made, in the employ of Spain, four voyages to
the east coast of South America and built a fort
on the coast of Brazil, and from him, or rather in
his honor, the western continent was named
&ldquo;America&rdquo;&mdash;the name first appearing in a little
pamphlet published in France in 1507 by Waldseemuler,
a German geographer, who gave as his
reason for the name the following, viz.: &ldquo;The
fourth part of the world having been discovered
by Americus, it may be called the land of Americus
or America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Between the years 1512 and 1542 Ponce de Leon,
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
Balboa, Cortez, Narvaez, Cabeza de Vaca, De
Soto, Pizarro, and Coronado, all for Spain, had
made extensive and very important discoveries
in what are now the southern of the United States,
the Mississippi river, Mexico, and Peru. Some of
these men became infamous by their horrible
crimes. They were arrogant and frank. Balboa,
in 1513, was the first European to discover the
&ldquo;South sea&rdquo; (the Pacific ocean), and &ldquo;wading
into its waters drew his sword and declared that
the Kings of Spain should hold possession of the
&lsquo;South sea&rsquo; and of its coasts and islands &lsquo;while
the earth revolves, and until the universal judgment
of mankind.&rsquo;&rdquo; Cortez bluffly declared in
a few words when speaking to the Mexicans the
motives of the Spanish as follows: &ldquo;We
Spaniards are troubled with a disease of the heart
for which we find gold and gold only a specific
remedy.&rdquo; These discoverers, explorers, freebooters
from Spain in her vast territory New
Spain, merited the just contempt not only of the
ancient civilizations of Mexico and Peru but also
of the whole enlightened world. It seems to have
been the firm belief of the Spaniard for centuries
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
that he is made of a finer material than any other
nation and destined to rule and others to obey.</p>
<p>The French disputed the Spanish claims to
North America and established a colony of Huguenots
in South Carolina, but France&rsquo;s discoveries
and possessions in North America were principally
in the north. Cartier discovered and
explored the St. Lawrence river in 1535, and that
was thought to be a part, if not all, of the water-way
through the continent of America to the
South sea or Pacific ocean en route to India. No
nation was more zealous and successful than
France in making discoveries and settlements in
Canada, and what ultimately became the northwestern
of the United States along the upper lakes
and the upper Mississippi river, by those wonderful
religious orders, the Franciscans and Jesuits.</p>
<p>Eighty-five years had elapsed after the discovery
in North America by the Cabots, under
which the English based their claim to the territory,
before they made any attempt at colonization
or even to establish a permanent settlement.
In 1584 that unique, able, versatile, vain Queen
Elizabeth of England granted a most remarkable
charter to, at one time her especial favorite, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
highly gifted but eccentric Sir Walter Raleigh,
to lay claim to any land in the west &ldquo;not actually
possessed by any Christian prince.&rdquo; Raleigh
sent out several expeditions to make a settlement
on Roanoke island, off the coast of North Carolina.
It was represented to the Queen as a
remarkably fine land, so that she named it in her
own honor as the Virgin Queen Virginia and
thereupon knighted Raleigh. Raleigh, though he
made determined and prolonged efforts and at
great personal expense to establish permanent
English settlements in America, failed. To Sir
Walter Raleigh is given the credit or curse of
having discovered in Virginia a weed which King
James called &ldquo;the vilest of weeds&rdquo; and Edmund
Spencer, the famous poet, &ldquo;divine tobacco.&rdquo; To
Sir Walter also is generally given the credit of
having introduced the most valuable of all the
vegetables known to man&mdash;the potato.</p>
<p>Justin Winsor, a distinguished American historian,
said that the scheme to form a West India
Company was first broached in 1592 by William
Usselinx, an exiled Antwerp merchant. It was
many years before it could be accomplished. The
longing for a share in the riches of the New World
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
conduced in the meantime to the establishment of
the &ldquo;Greenland Company&rdquo; about 1596 and the
pretended search by its ships for a northwestern
passage led to a supposed first discovery of the
Hudson river, if we may rely upon an unsupported
statement by the officers of the West India
Company in an appeal for assistance to the
Assembly of the Nineteenth in 1644. According
to this statement ships of the &ldquo;Greenland Company&rdquo;
had entered the North and Delaware
rivers in 1598; their crews had landed in both
places and had built small forts to protect them
against the inclemency of the weather and to
resist the attacks of the Indians.</p>
<p>A company of English merchants had organized
to trade to America in the first year of the seventeenth
century. Their first adventure to Guiana
and Virginia were not successful yet gave a new
impetus to the scheme originally conceived by
Usselinx. A plan for the organization of a
West India Company was drawn up in 1606,
according to the excited Belgian ideas. This company
was to have an existence of thirty-six years;
to receive during the first six years assistance
from all the United Provinces, and to be managed
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
in the same manner as the East India Company.
It was not consummated. Olden-Barneveldt, the
Advocate of Holland and one of the most
prominent and influential members of the peace
party, foresaw that the organization of a West
India Company with the avowed purpose of
obtaining most of its profits by preying on
Spanish commerce in American waters would
only prolong the war. Usselinx&rsquo;s plan was to
compel Spain by these means to evacuate Belgium
and thus give her exiled sons a chance to return
to their old home. A wholesale departure of the
shrewd, industrious, and skilful Belgians would
have deprived Holland of her political pre-eminence
and have left her an obscure and isolated
province. The conflicting views and claims of the
provinces caused the scheme to fail until after
Olden-Barneveldt, accused of high treason, was
tried, condemned, and beheaded in 1619. Subsequently
Maurice of Nassau took up the scheme of
forming the Dutch West India Company. Private
ships sailing from Dutch ports had not been idle
in the meantime; in 1607 we hear of them in
Canada trading for furs. Belgium and the
Netherlands, compelled to become maritime
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
nations, while other circumstances directed to
commercial pursuits, had become the common carriers
of the sea and the Netherlands especially had
availed themselves of the discoveries made by the
Cabots, Verrazano, and other adventurous
explorers in the country succeeding Columbus&rsquo;
discovery of America. They thought Spain most
assailable in the West Indies where they could
prey upon their commerce and capture their
treasures from Mexico and Peru. The first proposition
to make such an expedition was submitted
to the States General in 1581 by an English sea
captain named Beets. It was refused. Later it
gained favor and caused the formation of a West
India Company really to fight Spain and not
ignoring the search for a shorter route to India.</p>
<p>Before Henry Hudson&rsquo;s attempts to find a
<i>northwest</i> passage to India six trials had been
made and subsequently more than twenty-five
more, and while it is claimed that Sir Robert
McClure in his expedition in 1650-54 succeeded,
it was only by abandoning his vessel and completing
his way on ice. The discovery is of no
practical utility.</p>
<p>In 1606 James I, King of England, Scotland
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
and Ireland, granted two charters&mdash;one to the
London Company giving it power to establish
settlements anywhere between the thirty-fourth
and thirty-eighth degrees of north latitude (that
is between Cape Fear and the Potomac); and the
other to the Plymouth Company granting it the
territory in Northern Virginia between the forty-first
and the forty-fifth degrees of north latitude
(that is between the eastern end of Long Island
and the northern limit of Nova Scotia), with the
right to establish settlements therein. Each of
these grants extended 100 miles inland. The territory
between these two companies (from thirty-ninth
to forty-first degrees), embracing what is
Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, and a little of
New York, was open to settlement by either of
these companies, provided that neither should
make a settlement within 100 miles of the other.</p>
<p>It is not presumable that the alert, watchful,
shrewd Amsterdam directors of the Dutch East
India Company were ignorant of the discoveries,
explorations, and important events in the western
world nor of the charters of 1606 granted by King
James which seemed to leave an unoccupied and
an unknown territory extending from the thirty-eight
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
to the forty-eight degrees of North latitude
which would furnish the Netherlands a desirable
base for their operations in America against
Spain. Perhaps that territory might be secured
under the right of prior discovery if a small craft
was sent out nominally to sail northeast as a blind
but really westward for the double purpose either
of finding a shorter route to India or obtaining a
desirable foothold in the New World.</p>
<p>Let us see whether we may ascertain more
about Hudson&rsquo;s views, preparation, and knowledge
before the contract was entered into with the
Amsterdam directors of the Dutch East India
Company. In his second voyage in the employ of
the Muscovy Company, under date of August 7,
1608, he made the following entry into his journal:
&ldquo;I used all diligence to arrive in London, for
being at Nova Zembla on the 8th day of July and
void of hope of a northeast route except by Vaygats,
for which I was not fitted to try or prove, I
therefore resolved to use all means I could to sail
to the <i>northwest</i> (which would have been in direct
violation of his instructions) and to make trial at
Lumley&rsquo;s Inlet and Captain Davis Straits, hoping
to run into it a hundred leagues and return.&rdquo; He
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
did not carry out his resolve but indicated his
desire to seek a <i>northwestern</i> passage then.</p>
<p>Henry Hudson was not wild, erratic, nor a
rover. Perhaps no one whom Hudson met in
London so much determined his course as did
Captain John Smith, a very remarkable English
adventurer&mdash;a daring rover in early life, entering
military service in several of the European
governments, captured, imprisoned, and escaped
to play such a prominent part in establishing the
first permanent English settlement in Virginia in
the United States. Captain John Smith&rsquo;s name
is almost always associated with that of Pocahontas
(the daughter of the famous Chief Powhatan)
who while yet a girl but twelve years is
said to have interposed her body and thereby
saved the life of Captain Smith from the uplifted
war clubs of the Indians about to descend upon
him. Captain Smith also corresponded with
Hudson, gave him maps of North America and
advised him as to the course to be pursued in
seeking a westward watercourse to India. Perhaps
the maps most serviceable to Hudson in his
voyage westward in 1609 were those of New
France, which plainly represented the Grande
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
river (subsequently called the Hudson river), and
were published in the sixteenth century. Hudson
was also a theorist. He believed in an &ldquo;Open
Polar Sea&rdquo; and so far as is known was the first
to promulgate that theory, entertained and followed
by searchers after the North Pole. Hudson
made the acquaintance and won the friendship of
learned geographers in Amsterdam, prominent
among them was the Reverend Peter Plancius,
who said it was reasonable that the sea should be
open near the Pole where the sun shines incessantly
for months though with less heat than
where it shines only a few hours by day and the
hours of the night intervening, cooling. Hudson
said his experience convinced him, for after passing
beyond a certain line (about 66&deg; north latitude)
the sea became more open as he went further
north. This Doctor Peter Plancius was a member
of the Reformed Church and as such driven from
his Belgian home by the Spaniards, he heartily
co-operated with Usselinx in his plan to form a
West India Company. He was often in consultation
with Hudson in Amsterdam and to his chapter
on &ldquo;Norumbega (said to be somewhere in
New England) et Virginia&rdquo; he added a map
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
which, imperfect in some respect&mdash;incorrect in
its latitudes&mdash;was serviceable to Hudson in his
westward voyage. The French map of about 1517
and the map of Thomas Hood, an Englishman,
published in 1594, which shows under latitude 40&deg;
north (New York city is 40&deg; 43&prime; north) the mouth
of a river called Rio de San Antonio, the name
given by the earliest Spanish discoverers to what
later on became known as the Hudson river. In
this connection it may not be amiss to call attention
to the historical fact that Giovanni da Verrazano,
a Florentine navigator in the employ of
Francis I, King of France, entered the New York
bay and saw at least the mouth of the river which
the French called the &ldquo;Grande river&rdquo; in 1524,
eighty-five years before Henry Hudson saw it.
It is further claimed that soon after the French
built a fort on Castle Island near Albany and
there carried on a trade in furs with the Indians.
Some historians discredit this French claim,
which, however, seems sustained though it never
resulted in advantage to the French. A map
made by Vaz Dornado at Lisbon in 1571 gives the
Hudson river in almost its entire course from the
mountains to the bay. A copy of this map made
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
in 1580, which went to Munich, was probably seen
by Dr. Plancius, Hudson&rsquo;s friend and adviser.
<i>Johannes de Laet</i>, a director of the West India
company and a copatroon of Rensselaerwick with
Kilian Van Rensselaer, admits in his book that
the object of the West India Company was <i>war on
Spain, and he congratulates the country upon its
success</i>.</p>
<p>Jean Wagenaar, a Dutch historian, a historiographer,
the secretary of the city of Amsterdam,
held in the highest esteem, who had free access
to the archives and whose statements are not to
be discredited, says the company &ldquo;<i>sent out a
skipper to discover a passage to China by the
Northwest not by the Northeast</i>.&rdquo; <i>A resolution
of the States of Holland, quoted by this same
authority, proves that previous to Hudson&rsquo;s voyage,
the Dutch knew that they would find terra
firma north of the Spanish possessions and contiguous
to them.</i></p>
<p><i>Resolved, &ldquo;That by carrying the war over to
America, the Spaniards be attacked there where
their weakest point is, but whence they draw the
most of their resources.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>As much has appeared in this article concerning
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
the sincerity of the motives actuating the parties
to the contract of January 8, 1609, and as doubts
and adverse criticisms had been expressed and
no authority given therefor&mdash;they seemed conjectures&mdash;perhaps
not unreasonable, plausible
but requiring confirmation&mdash;<i>proof</i> to be entitled
to credit.</p>
<p>Not, however, until the latter half of the nineteenth
century was any documentary evidence on
that subject obtainable and published, though
efforts had been made before.</p>
<p>The Hon. Henry Cruse Murphy, born in Brooklyn
in 1810, prepared in the High School for
Columbia College, where he graduated with honor
in 1830, studied law, was admitted to practice in
1833, married in 1834, mayor of Brooklyn, member
of two State constitutional conventions, five
times elected to the Senate of the State of New
York, a gentleman of culture and refinement,
author and founder of the Brooklyn Eagle, whom,
in 1857, President Buchanan appointed Minister
to The Hague, exceptionally well qualified to represent
the United States. His pleasing manners
enabled him to obtain most valuable information
about the war between Spain and the Netherlands,
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
and also about the early settlement of North
America. He first gives to the public an exact
copy of that contract of January, 1609, where
there could be no doubt that the navigator&rsquo;s name
was <i>Henry</i>, not Hendrick.</p>
<p>The Minister says: &ldquo;The following memoir is
the result of an investigation made for the purpose
of ascertaining more precisely than has
hitherto been explained, the circumstances which
originated the voyage made on behalf of the Dutch
East India Company by Henry Hudson; the
motives, purposes and character of its projectors
and the designs of the navigator himself at the
time he sailed upon that expedition. We have
examined the records of the East India Company,
comprising the registers or book of resolutions of
the general of the company, styled the Council of
Seventeen, and the Chambers of Amsterdam,
Zealand, etc., with some other documents among
the archives of the Kingdom at The Hague, where
all the books and papers of the company have been
brought from the several chambers, have been
arranged and kept. A copy of the contract between
Hudson and two members of the Chamber
of Amsterdam (as given on previous pages), was
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
found appended to a history of the company never
published, but prepared at its request by Mr.
P. Van Dam, who held the position of counsel of
the company for the extraordinary period of fifty-four
years, that is, from 1652 until his death in
1706.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Amsterdam Chamber of the Dutch East
India Company had, among its members, enterprising
merchants who had a particular motive in
seeking to secure Hudson&rsquo;s services. They wished
to forestall others, and especially their own
country, in the discovery, and thus prevent any
interference with their chartered monopoly of the
East India trade. The evidence of this policy distinctly
appears in the resolutions and proceedings
of the general council of all the chambers of the
company, called the &ldquo;Council of Seventeen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The company itself, shortly after its organization,
took into consideration the expediency of
making an attempt to explore the northern passage
and of soliciting the necessary privileges from
the government. It is quite apparent, therefore,
that the fears and the hopes of opening that route
still existed in the minds of some of the directors.</p>
<p>The Council of Seventeen determined finally
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
that it was inexpedient to make the trial. Their
determination was, however, accompanied by a
remarkable resolution. The final action of the
Council of Seventeen took place on the 7th of
August, 1603, and is thus entered in the minutes:
&ldquo;It is likewise for deliberation and resolution
whether the voyage by the North shall also be
undertaken and negotiations be had with the Noble
Lord States in regards to terms and privileges for
that purpose seeing that some private persons
have already been in communication with said
Lords; the more so as this matter at the meeting
of the 17 on the 27th of Feby last past was postponed
as appears by the 17th section of the proceedings
of that meeting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the margin is the following disposition of
that subject: &ldquo;The contents hereof are rejected
as it is deemed not serviceable to the Co, and
therefore if this navigation should be undertaken
by any private person it ought by all means to be
prevented.&rdquo; The company was realizing by the
southern route enormous profits, dividing among
its stockholders 37 per cent. for its first two years.</p>
<p>The States General, by a decree on the 1st of
July, 1606, expressly prohibited from navigating
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
by the Cape of Good Hope and the Straits of
Magellan, and in the following September, by
another decree, the subjects of the Netherlands
were prohibited from carrying on the trade.</p>
<p>The entire period is so short, concerning which
we know anything about Henry Hudson, do we
really know enough of him to form a true and
fair estimate of his character?</p>
<p>We do know that Hudson had made two (and
we don&rsquo;t know how many more) voyages north of
Siberia, in the employ of the Muscovy Company,
intending to go east and then south, down to
Cathay, but did not succeed. He had, however,
been exposed, inured to the arctic colds, privations
and dangers, and had won the rank of captain.
What did he know about the recently explored
seas and lands or what more did he need to know
about them, if he was in the employ of the Dutch
East India Company through its Amsterdam
Chambers, two directors to pursue the same course
he had on the two voyages he had for the Muscovy
Company?</p>
<p>Before Henry Hudson had signed the famous
contract on the 8th of January, 1609, he had been
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
a careful geographical student, as far as he had
opportunity.</p>
<p>About the beginning of the seventeenth century,
after the Belgians, on account of their religious
views, had been expelled from Belgium, and many
of them gone to Holland&mdash;mostly to Amsterdam,
then that city and London, England, became the
great rendezvous for navigators, discoverers,
would-be discoverers, or explorers, to discuss matters,
compare notes, and get all information possible
on such subjects.</p>
<p>The Muscovy Company had headquarters in
London, where Hudson would go, and there he
met, it is known, Captain John Smith, and it is
probable that there he met and formed a favorable
opinion of Jodocus Hondius, who was his interpreter,
adviser, and witness to the contract of
January 8th. He was an educated gentleman, a
minister of the Reformed Church, a Belgian,
driven out of his country, went to London, a
geographer, map-maker and portrait painter. He
painted Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s portrait. The center
around which the Belgians then gathered as their
brightest man in discovery was Peter Plancius,
another Belgian, a Calvinistic minister driven
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
from Belgium, and who had settled in Amsterdam,
and was a devoted friend and adviser of Hudson.
Hudson before he had engaged with the Amsterdam
directors had seen and examined the most
important maps of the French, English, Spanish
and Portuguese, and especially of the Arctic
regions, New York and Canada, and had borrowed
some of them from Plancius and Smith, and those
that he wanted most were about the northwest and
above 35&deg; north latitude.</p>
<p>Hudson&rsquo;s friends were warm, zealous to help
him, that they might lessen the power and vindictiveness
of the Spaniards.</p>
<p>Captain John Smith sent Captain Henry Hudson
important maps and instructions from Virginia,
before Hudson set sail in the &ldquo;Half Moon.&rdquo;
Smith&rsquo;s advice to Hudson seems to have been to
seek a passage to the Pacific ocean at about 40&deg;
north latitude or about 50&deg; north latitude, or still
farther north, and seek a passage through Lumly
inlet or some other entrance into the Hudson bay.
Hudson made extraordinary preparations if he
did not expect to pursue that course for the
Amsterdam Chamber of the Dutch East India
Company.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>That Henry Hudson first discovered, at least
first reported, the &ldquo;Open Sea&rdquo; north of 66&deg; north
is conceded, and that has been confirmed by several
Arctic explorers since&mdash;prominent among
them Dr. Kane. That Sebastian Cabot discovered
Hudson straits in about 1517 is admitted.</p>
<p>Jodocus Hondius, a warm friend of Hudson,
tried to dissuade him from entering Hudson bay
in hopes to find a passage to the Pacific, for he
told him that a relative of his had explored the
bay, and that there was no communication with
the Pacific ocean.</p>
<p>Read, Jr., says our sense of the loss of Hudson&rsquo;s
own journal in conclusion with his discovery of
Delaware bay is indeed irreparable. Our sense of
the loss is increased by the remembrance that the
Hudson river, Hudson strait and Hudson bay had
been visited long before Hudson explored them.
George Weymouth had visited the mouth of Hudson
straits.</p>
<p>Gerard Mercator&rsquo;s celebrated map of the world,
made at Duisburg, Germany, in 1569, shows the
French fort on the east side of the Grande (or
Hudson) river. He outlined the Hudson to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
height of its navigation with the Mohawk as far
as the French had explored it.</p>
<p><i>Winsor</i>, 1520, vol. 4, p. 434. The Pompey Stone
and Spaniards in New York State, found in
Oneida county with its Spanish inscriptions and
date of 1520, and the names of places given in
their corruption by the Dutch in a grant conveying
part of Albany county. We can no longer hesitate
to believe that the heathen reported by
Danskon and other writers mentioned before had
some foundation, and that the Spaniards knew and
had explored the country on the Hudson long
before the Dutch came, but had thought, as Peter
Martys expresses it, after the failure of Estibon
Comez and the Leconcrado d&rsquo;Aillen &ldquo;To the
South, to the South for the great and exceeding
riches of the Equator. They that seek gold must
not go to the cold North.&rdquo; The Spaniards never
considered New Netherlands of any value itself.</p>
<p>The Pompey Stone was located near where the
Cardiff Giant was found and I do not build on it.</p>
<p>That Giovanni de Verazzano, in the French ship
&ldquo;La Dauphin,&rdquo; with a crew of fifty men, commissioned
by Francis I, King of France, to make
discoveries of new lands entered the lower and
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
upper bays of what now is New York, and the
mouth of the North, or now called the Hudson
river, is conceded. He tried to ascend the river,
thinking it the water route to the South sea or
the Pacific ocean on the way to Cathay and the
East Indies. A violent gale sprang up and compelled
him to go to sea, and his discoveries along
the coast of North America, from Florida to the
Gulf of St. Lawrence, resulted in the French
claiming that territory as La Nouvelle France
(New France), an extent of more than 1,100 miles.</p>
<p>The valuable furs and peltries of New France
induced French merchants, ship owners and capitalists
to send many vessels with merchandise to
trade with the Indians. Some of these vessels
sailed up the river (North or Hudson) to the
height of its navigation, where the Mohawk enters
into it. For protection and for a trading-house,
the French built a fortified trading-house or castle
in 1540, lying in the little bay on the west side of
the river, called by the French the &ldquo;Grande
river,&rdquo; near the site of Albany. Before the castle
was completed the island was inundated by a great
freshet. The earliest Europeans, coming to what
is now New York, did not come intending to settle,
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
but to gain in dealing in furs and peltry, and in
that pursuit they became well acquainted with the
topography of the country. On many of the maps
of New France the Grande river is plainly represented
from Sandy Hook to its navigable limits,
about 175 miles.</p>
<p>Sincerely believing that the honors awarded
Henry Hudson, the famous navigator, are not on
the true basis, and that at the tercentenary they
are likely to be perpetuated against historical
facts, I have cited evidence and will add but two
more from his own countrymen, viz.: John Knox
Laughton, Professor of History in Kings College,
London, since 1885, and C. M. Asher, LL. D.,
&ldquo;Henry Hudson, the Navigator. The original
documents in which his career is recorded printed
in London, 1860, for the highly distinguished historical
body, the Hakluyt Society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Professor Laughton, in the Dictionary of National
Biography, vol. 28, pp. 148 and 149, says:
&ldquo;Hudson&rsquo;s personality is shady in the extreme,
and his achievements have been the subject of
much exaggeration and misrepresentation. The
River, the Strait, the Bay and the vast tract of
land which bears his name have kept his memory
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
alive; <i>but in point of fact not one of these was
discovered by Hudson</i>. All that can be seriously
claimed for him is that he pushed his <i>explorations</i>
further than his predecessors and left them a more
distinct but still imperfect record. It has been
conclusively shown by Dr. Asher that the River,
Strait and the Bay were all marked in maps many
years before the time of Hudson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In April, 1614, Hudson&rsquo;s widow applied to the
East India Company for some employment for
another son, she being left very poor. The company
considered that the boy had a just claim
on them, as his father had perished in the service
of the commonwealth; they accordingly placed
him for nautical instruction in the Samaritan and
gave five pounds toward his outfit.&rdquo; Henry Hudson,
born about 1560.</p>
<p>Dr. Asher, in his publication, says: &ldquo;<i>Hudson
river, Hudson strait and Hudson bay remind
every educated man of the illustrious navigator
by whom they were explored.</i>&rdquo; But though the
name of Henry Hudson possesses the preservative
against oblivion, little more has been done in its
behalf, and few persons have any accurate notion
of the real extent of its merits. By considering
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
Hudson as the discoverer of the three mighty
waters that bear his name, we indeed both overrate
and underrate his deserts. For it is certain
that these localities <i>had</i> repeatedly been visited,
and even drawn on maps and charts long before
he set out on his voyages.</p>
<p>Special attention is called to Justin Winsor&rsquo;s
&ldquo;America,&rdquo; and to Henry Cruse Murphy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hudson
in Holland.&rdquo; The naming of the territorial
empire of Prince Rupert&rsquo;s land upon which Hudson,
perhaps, never set his foot, seems more than
strange.</p>
<p>The retrospect has been long, and though only
by glances, far from complete, doubtless it has
been tedious, but to differ from public opinion it
seemed necessary to give strong reasons.</p>
<p>Does it not, then, seem that the contract made
by the Amsterdam directors and Henry Hudson
was rather a blind, and for political reasons, than
genuine?</p>
<p>Some historians say that Henry Hudson, when
in the employ of the Dutch East India Company,
set sail from Amsterdam March 25, 1609, and
others April 4, 1609&mdash;there is no discrepancy, for
the former is what is called Old Style, and the
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
latter New Style, of reckoning time. Some authorities
state Hudson had two vessels, namely, the
&ldquo;Good Hope&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Half Moon.&rdquo; The contract
between the Amsterdam directors of the
Dutch East India Company and Henry Hudson
names the &ldquo;Half Moon&rdquo; and no other. Moreover,
the Hon. Henry C. Murphy, when United
States Minister to Holland, ascertained from the
archives that the Amsterdam directors of the
Dutch East India Company did have, in 1608, a
vessel named &ldquo;Good Hope,&rdquo; which sailed April
15, 1608, for the East Indies, and was captured by
the Spaniards.</p>
<p>The crew of the &ldquo;Half Moon,&rdquo; under Henry
Hudson as master, consisted of about twenty, part
Dutch and part English, many of them had served
under him while he was in the employ of the Muscovy
Company&mdash;his son being one of that number.
The &ldquo;Half Moon&rdquo; was a yacht of about
eighty tons burden. Hudson followed the route
he had taken when in the employ of the Muscovy
Company until he met with the same obstacles as
in his previous expedition, namely, impenetrable
ice, fogs and adverse winds which drove him backward.
Then he submitted the choice to his crew
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
to decide whether they should sail to the coast of
America, latitude 40&deg; north (New Jersey coast)
or in search of Davis strait latitude, about 62&deg;
north. Many of his crew had been sailors in
southern warmer waters and chose the lower latitude,
while then, it is said, Hudson preferred the
other, but must submit to the wishes of the crew.
On the 14th of May Hudson sailed the &ldquo;Half
Moon&rdquo; westward, and a fortnight later reached
the Faroe islands, replenished his water casks, and
set sail again, making slow progress for a month
against fierce gales, but on the 2d of July was at
the grand banks of Newfoundland, with foremast
gone and the sails badly torn. There they found
a large fleet of Frenchmen fishing, but had no
intercourse with them. Becalmed, the &ldquo;Half
Moon&rdquo; men caught cod. Having made the needed
repairs they set sail again, and on the 12th of July
Hudson was gladdened by the sight of America&rsquo;s
shores. The &ldquo;Half Moon&rdquo; entered and anchored
in a safe and large harbor (probably Penobscot
bay) on the coast of Maine. Here an unfortunate
and wanton attack was made by the crew upon the
natives, and Hudson at once set sail, and did not
approach land again until August 3d, when he
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
sent five men ashore who returned loaded with
rose trees and grapes. He supposed that the place
was &ldquo;Cape Cod,&rdquo; which Gonold had so named in
1602. Then for two weeks the &ldquo;Half Moon&rdquo;
sailed south and came to the mouth of King James
river in Virginia. Then Hudson coasted northerly
and Friday, August 28th, entered the great Delaware
bay. After exploring, he became satisfied
that there was no passage-way there to China, and
emerging from the bay went north, and September
3, 1609, entered and anchored under the shelter
of what is called Sandy Hook. On the 12th of
September Henry Hudson entered the Hudson
river.</p>
<p>Drifting with the tide, he anchored over night
(the 13th) just above Yonkers; on the 14th passed
Tappan and Haverstraw bays, entered the Highlands
and anchored for the night near West Point.
On the morning of the 15th he entered Newburgh
bay and reached Catskill on the 16th, Athens on
the 17th and Castleton and Albany on the 18th,
and then sent out an exploring boat as far as
Waterford.</p>
<p>Some historians say that Hudson anchored at
Hudson and sent a boat containing his mate and
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
four men further up the river to explore and
report whether it seemed to be a water-way to the
South sea (Pacific ocean) on the way to India.
Becoming convinced that it did not, on the 23d of
September he leisurely sailed down the river to its
mouth. Hudson and his crew were greatly pleased
with the grandeur and beauty of the river, the
like of which they had never seen, passing through
a fruitful, attractive country, which in their
descriptions, they painted in glowing colors, justly
deserved. It was the season of the year when
nature, in that latitude, dons her variegated and
most beautiful colors. Hudson had, along the
river in many places where he stopped, many
interesting and pleasant interviews with the Indians,
gaining much information, and exchanging
his trinkets for their valuable furs. The Indians,
as a rule, were hospitable, entertaining the
strangers with game and fruits, etc. There were
a few regrettable incidents on Hudson&rsquo;s voyage
up the river between the Indians and the crew, and
it seems probable the latter were most blameworthy.</p>
<p>October 4, 1609, Henry Hudson and his crew in
the &ldquo;Half Moon&rdquo; set sail from Sandy Hook for
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
Europe. On the homeward voyage some of the
crew wanted to winter in Newfoundland and then
in the spring search for a northwestern passage
through Davis strait. Many were sick, but none
of them were willing to go back to Holland as
Hudson wished and was under obligations to do.
Bear in mind that the master of a vessel then was
not the autocrat that he now is. The crew had
to be consulted and their decision controlled. A
compromise was finally made that they should sail
to Ireland. However, they reached Dartmouth,
England, November 7, 1609, from which place
Hudson made his report to the Dutch East India
Company directors, and proposed to them to go
out again for a search in the northwest, and that
besides the pay, 1,500 florins should be laid out
for an additional supply of provisions. Hudson
also wanted six or seven of his men exchanged and
his crew to number twenty.</p>
<p>It was a long time before the Dutch East India
Company directors learned of the arrival of the
&ldquo;Half Moon&rdquo; and heard from Hudson. Then
they ordered the ship and crew to return as soon
as possible. But when they were going to do so,
Hudson and other Englishmen were commanded
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
by the government not to leave England, but to
serve their own country. These things took place
in January, 1610. After a detention of eight
months in England the &ldquo;Half Moon&rdquo; reached
Amsterdam in the summer of 1610.</p>
<p>April 17, 1610, Henry Hudson, in the vessel
&ldquo;Discovery,&rdquo; with many of his crew of former
voyages, sailed from England in the service of
three Englishmen, Sir Thomas Smythe, Sir Dudley
Digges, and John Wolstenholme, in quest of
an all-water route to India through the Davis
strait. After entering the bay named Hudson, in
his honor, he spent much time in trying to find an
outlet from it to the Pacific ocean on the way to
China, but unsuccessfully.</p>
<p>His crew became quarrelsome, and some of them
mutinous. Among the worst were two he had
favored most&mdash;one his mate, Juet, and another,
a Mr. Green, a worthless, degenerate fellow. Juet
was tried for insubordination&mdash;for attempting to
incite to mutiny&mdash;found guilty and deposed. The
winter of 1610-1611 was a hard one&mdash;their provisions
were short, owing to a treatment of a
native by some of the crew&mdash;they could obtain no
game from the Indians, nor could they catch fish.
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
It was said, perhaps falsely, that Hudson became
very tyrannical, and said something that his enemies
thought he meant to prolong his scanty supplies
by getting rid of several of the crew. June,
1611, a few days after leaving one of the most
southern harbors of James bay (a southern portion
of Hudson bay) where they had wintered, a
mutiny broke out among the crew. Hudson was
seized and bound, and he, his son and seven
others, principally sick and infirm, were put in a
small boat and set adrift upon the waves, destined
soon to perish.</p>
<p>Thus ended, in tragedy, the career of a remarkable
man, whose appearance upon the theater had
not extended a half dozen years.</p>
<p>To commemorate the tercentenary of <i>Hendrick</i>
Hudson&rsquo;s <i>discovery</i> of the Hudson river would
be on a false basis&mdash;at war with historical facts.
Hudson&rsquo;s name was <i>Henry</i> (as has been clearly
established) and not <i>Hendrick</i>, as doubtless the
Dutch wanted him to become a Hollander on his
entering the service of the Dutch East India
Company.</p>
<p>There is no evidence that Henry Hudson was
ever in Holland except late in the year 1608 and
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
early in the year 1609. It is certain that he did
not see Holland after his expedition on behalf of
the Dutch East India Company, and that born
in England, he remained an Englishman, for that
government forbid him, as an Englishman, to
leave and enter any other service.</p>
<p>It seems most remarkable that in Hudson&rsquo;s
honor, as a discoverer, should have been named a
<i>strait</i> (Hudson strait discovered by Sebastian
Cabot in 1517), <i>Hudson bay</i>, the <i>Hudson Bay Company
territory</i>, which originally included all the
land which was drained into Hudson bay&mdash;territory
ample for an empire&mdash;which Hudson did not
discover and probably never put his foot on its
soil, and the <i>Hudson river</i>, which has been clearly
shown he did not discover. Unless the word <i>discoverer</i>
has a different meaning from what the
public understand by it and lexicographers primarily
ascribe to it, Hudson, in none of these
cases, was a <i>discoverer</i>. He was an <i>explorer</i>, and
as such was a benefactor, and deserved credit. We
would &ldquo;render unto C&aelig;sar the things which are
C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry Hudson was a bold, skillful navigator, a
careful explorer, and had the ability and spirit
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
to have made important discoveries had the time
and circumstances favored. It often happens that
the discoverer, the inventor, merits less honor than
the party coming after, who makes that discovery
or invention serviceable&mdash;useful, as it had not
been before. Robert Fulton was not the discoverer
of the application of steam as a motive power
in navigation, but he built the &ldquo;Clermont&rdquo;&mdash;propelled
it by steam from New York to Albany,
took the wind out of sails, revolutionized navigation,
and received the honors. Samuel Finley
Breese Morse was not the discoverer, the inventor
of the electrical telegraph, but he made it serviceable&mdash;of
practical utility&mdash;almost ignoring distance
in the transmission of news, and he won the
honors.</p>
<p>Henry Hudson did not discover a new and
shorter water route to India, nor did he discover
the Hudson river. He, however, did <i>explore</i> the
Hudson river, and his glowing accounts of it, and
the country through which it flows, attracted immigration,
settlements, and was an important element
in the founding of the new nation in the
western world. The name, it is to be hoped, the
<i>true</i> name of Hudson, <i>Henry</i>, and not <i>Hendrick</i>,
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
will be cherished, for whom living, so little was
done. His widow, in extreme poverty, applied to
the British government for another of her sons,
and he was received and sent to the Government
Naval School, and an allowance was made for his
outfit. Henry Hudson appears to have had a large
family.</p>
<p>The river which Hudson sailed up and down in
1609 has borne many names, given by different
peoples at different times. The red men bestow
names descriptive or characteristic&mdash;while there
are no known laws or rules which the white men
observe in naming. At the advent of the Europeans
to North America many tribes of Indians
inhabited the territory from Florida to the St.
Lawrence, and back to the Mississippi river, and
prominent among them were the Lenapes, to which
the Mohicans belonged. These Indians called the
river Mah-i-can-i-tuk, meaning &ldquo;the flowing
waters.&rdquo; The Iroquois called it Co-hat-a-tea, or
&ldquo;river that flows from the mountains.&rdquo; It was
called the Mauritius, in honor of Prince Maurice
of Nassau. Rio de Montagne was a name given
to it. The French usually called it &ldquo;Le Grande.&rdquo;
The Spanish called it &ldquo;The River of the Mountains.&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
It was often called the &ldquo;North river&rdquo;
in contradistinction to the &ldquo;South river&rdquo;&mdash;the
Delaware.</p>
<p>That Henry Hudson was greatly pleased in
exploring this river is not surprising. &ldquo;There is
no river in the western world comparable with
it in picturesqueness and beauty, nor has it a
superior, if an equal, in these respects, in Europe.
In some stretches of the Clyde and the Rhine are
features resembling the Hudson, and the Elbe has
in sections, such delicately penciled effects, but
no European river is so lordly in its bearing, none
flows in such state to the sea.&rdquo; It has been said
that no other river in the world presents so great
a variety of views as the Hudson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throughout its whole length, from the wilderness
to the sea, from the Adirondacks to Staten
Island, a distance of 325 miles, there is a combination
of the finest pictures, illustrating some of the
best scenery of the old world,&rdquo; which some quaint
writer (to me unknown) describes as follows:
&ldquo;The tourist with only a slight stretch of the
fancy may find Loch Katrine nestled among the
mountains of our own Highlands; in the Catskills
may be seen from Sunset Mountain of Arran; and
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
in the Palisades, the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway of Ireland.&rdquo;
He divides the Hudson river into five
stretches, reaches or divisions, representing five
distinct characteristics, namely: Grandeur, Repose,
Sublimity, The Picturesque, and Beauty.</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>1. The Palisades, an unbroken wall of rock for fifteen miles&mdash;<i>Grandeur.</i></dt>
<dt>2. The Tappanzee, surrounded by the sloping hills of Nyack, Tarrytown and Sleepy Hollow&mdash;<i>Repose.</i></dt>
<dt>3. The Highlands, where the Hudson for twenty miles plays &ldquo;hide and seek&rdquo; with hills &ldquo;rock-ribbed and ancient as the sun&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Sublimity.</i></dt>
<dt>4. The Hillsides, for miles above and below Poughkeepsie&mdash;<i>The Picturesque.</i></dt>
<dt>5. The Catskills, on the west, throned in queenly dignity&mdash;<i>Beauty.</i></dt></dl>
<p>George William Curtis, the great traveler, the
close observer, the perfect gentleman, pronounced
the Hudson grander than the Rhine, and Thackeray,
in his &ldquo;Virginians,&rdquo; has given the Hudson
the verdict of beauty.</p>
<p>To New Yorkers it is a river dear, for there is
scarcely a single settlement along its banks, from
its origin to the sea, which has not some interesting
tradition, some notable historic event, to relate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>The beauty and glory of such a river were not,
unaided, sufficient to induce the pioneer to leave
his home in civilization and go into a wilderness
thousands of miles away. Such a river as the
Hudson could not have its origin in a low, marshy
country, and its flow seaward, in any but a healthy
region, but the inducement to seek that country
must be more than the mere sentiment of beauty.
There must seem to be a prospect of bettering
one&rsquo;s condition, so far as physical comforts, or
civil and religious rights are concerned. Hudson,
after his exploration of the Hudson river, on his
return to Europe, took back there many very valuable
furs which he obtained from the Indians in
exchange for trinkets of little cost and of still less
real value. This fur and peltry trade was eagerly
sought by the Europeans, especially the French,
English and Dutch, and the latter were greatly
favored for a time, for the Indians from the far
north and northwest came to or near Albany to
market their goods and buy their supplies. In
the years 1610, 1611, 1612, 1613 and 1614 enterprising
Amsterdam merchants sent out vessels to
and up the Hudson river to obtain furs and peltry
and made large profits. In 1614 the territory
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
extending from Cape Cod to the Delaware river,
places which Hudson in his third voyage had
touched, was claimed by the Netherlands and
called New Netherlands, and in that year the Holland
government granted a special charter to a
company of Amsterdam merchants and others of
the United New Netherlands Company giving them
the monopoly until January 1, 1618, of all travel
and trade in the New Netherlands, during which
time they were at liberty to make four voyages.
For a period of five years, from 1618 to 1623, there
seems to have been a free trade in the New Netherlands&mdash;presumably
the fur trade proving less profitable.</p>
<p>June 3, 1621, the government of Holland, called
the &ldquo;Lords States General,&rdquo; incorporated the
Dutch West India Company, clothing it with
almost kingly powers, to carry on trade and planting
settlements from Cape Horn to Newfoundland
for a term of twenty-four years.</p>
<p>Its special object was the jurisdiction and
exclusive control in New Netherlands. Its government
was to be composed of nineteen directors
from the five different cities of Holland. The
Amsterdam Chamber was to have control of New
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
Netherlands. The company was not fully organized
until the spring of 1623. The English never
recognized the Dutch claim for the territory
called New Netherlands, and as early as 1613
demanded the surrender of the &ldquo;Dutch trading
house&rdquo; on Manhattan Island, and ten years later
the English Ambassador at The Hague protested
against the encroachment of the Dutch fur traders&mdash;the
English claiming the territory under the
discoveries of the Cabots in 1497 and 1498. In
April, 1623, thirty families, mostly Walloons, or
French Protestants, came over and landed at New
Amsterdam (New York) and eight of the families
came up to Albany and there built Fort Orange
near Steamboat Square, about two miles above
Fort Nassau, built several years before.</p>
<p>Prior to the coming of the company of the Walloons
to the New Netherlands the famous Pilgrim
colony had received a patent granted by the Virginia
Company giving them the right to settle
&ldquo;about the Hudson river,&rdquo; and when the &ldquo;Mayflower&rdquo;
left Southampton, England, that was her
destination, but mistaking the route and contrary
winds drove her to the Massachusetts coast and
there that colony was settled in 1620 at Plymouth
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
Rock. Had the Pilgrims settled in the New
Netherlands in 1620 the result doubtless would
have been different, but it is doubtful if it would
have been better or even so good. It is well to
bear in mind that the early settlements in New
England were made by persons seeking to avoid
persecution on account of their religious creeds,
at variance with Roman Catholicism and the
established Episcopal Church, and that they
might found and establish a home where they
could enjoy religious and civil rights. &ldquo;The
Pilgrims&rdquo; settled at Plymouth in 1620 and &ldquo;the
Puritans&rdquo; in Salem in 1629. Miles Standish was
a prominent figure and character among the Pilgrims,
though himself not a Pilgrim. Bradford,
Brewster, Winslow, and Carver were the trusted
leaders among the Pilgrims. Among the Puritans
John Endicott and John Winthrop were
easily the chiefs. The &ldquo;<i>Puritans</i>&rdquo; were members
of the established (Episcopal) church. They
sought to have that church purified. They wanted
the clergy to give up wearing the surplice, making
the sign of the cross in baptism and using the
ring in the marriage service&mdash;Roman Catholic
observances. The Separatists (afterward known
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
in America as the Pilgrims) were a branch of the
Puritans&mdash;ultra Puritans who utterly repudiated
Roman Catholic ceremonials and everything in
imitation of or like and therefore separated from
the established (Episcopal) church.</p>
<p>The Dutch did not come to the New Netherlands
on religious considerations, for Holland tolerated
religious freedom, but they came for gain&mdash;immediate
gain from the fur and peltry trade.
They did not early come to settle and for nearly
twenty years after Hudson&rsquo;s exploration and
glowing account of it very, very few indeed who
came over to engage in, or employed in the fur
trade, became settlers. It is said that Sarah
Rapelje, a daughter of one of the Walloon settlers,
born June 7, 1625, was the first white child
born in the New Netherlands. The first reference
to the population at Fort Orange (Albany) published
seems to have been in a work published in
Amsterdam in 1628, which says: &ldquo;There are no
families at Fort Orange. They keep twenty-five
or twenty-six traders there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The report made by the Nineteen in 1629 to the
Lords States General said: &ldquo;All who are inclined
to do any sort of work here procure enough to eat
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
without any trouble and therefore are not willing
to go far from home on an uncertainty.&rdquo; It was
apparent that if the Dutch West India Company
was to prove a success in the New Netherlands a
different course must be pursued, for Virginia and
New England were being settled and their territory,
in many respects better, was not.</p>
<p>The Dutch West India Company, modeled after
the Dutch East India Company, having powerful
fleets, sailing along the coasts of South America
and the West Indies, preying on the Spanish commerce,
capturing their vessels and cargoes and
amassing wealth thereby, sought to induce men of
wealth, daring, and ambition to relieve them of
the undertaking of settling and developing the
New Netherlands, which, instead of a source of
revenue, had become a burden. They hit upon
what was called the Patroon scheme&mdash;based upon
the Feudal System&mdash;a system of land tenure and
service prevalent in Europe during the Middle
Ages&mdash;a system inevitably tending to exalt the
Patroon into a lordly baron and to degrade his
subject into a serf.</p>
<p>One who sought the distinction of the title of a
Patroon (or Patron) of New Netherlands was
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
entitled to hold as a perpetual inheritance, handing
it down in the line of the oldest son, an estate
having sixteen miles frontage on one side of a
navigable river or eight miles on each side, extending
as far into the country as the occupiers would
permit. The Patroon must obtain Indian title,
which usually cost but a trifle. He was empowered
to hold civil and criminal courts on his estate and
his decisions were practically final. He appointed
the officers and magistrates in all the cities and
towns in his territory. In order to be invested
with this honor, these privileges and powers, he
bound himself to take or send over at least fifty
emigrants over fifteen years of age to settle on
his patent within the next four years.</p>
<p>The emigrants taken or sent by the Patroons
to New Netherlands were bound for a specified
number of years as apprentices to serve their
masters, agreeing not to hunt or fish without the
master&rsquo;s permission, agreeing to grind their grain
in his mill and pay his price for grinding. They
were pledged not to weave any cloth for themselves
or others, but to buy it from the company
under the penalty of banishment. They were
bound to pay rent in everything they produced.
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
The Patroon and his emigrants were to support a
schoolmaster, a minister and a comforter for the
sick.</p>
<p>Such in brief was the Patroon system.</p>
<p>The most desirable locations for selections in
the New Netherlands were along the Hudson and
Delaware rivers, known, of course, by the
directors of the Dutch West India Company;
prominent among them was Kiliaen Van Rensselaer,
a wealthy dealer in diamonds and pearls
in Amsterdam.</p>
<p>Van Rensselaer, doubtless, informed of the
great advantages of Albany, as the great rendezvous
of the Indians to market their furs and near
the confluence of the two most important rivers
of New York, instructed his agents to obtain title
from the Indians and he succeeded in procuring
a princely estate along the Hudson river above
and below Albany, a distance of twenty-four miles
and extending east and west forty-eight miles&mdash;a
territory ample for a kingdom&mdash;greater than
the area of North Holland and very little less than
that of South Holland.</p>
<p>Other directors of the Dutch West India Company
promptly made what they thought the most
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
desirable locations along the Hudson river.
Manhattan Island (New York) being reserved
by the company, and along the Delaware&mdash;immense
tracts, though none so extensive as Van
Rensselaer&rsquo;s, and became Patroons. Such grants
and under such circumstances soon excited
jealousy and sharp criticism in Holland and the
Patroons felt compelled to make concessions and
yield some of their privileges.</p>
<p>Kiliaen Van Rensselaer was a man of energy
and executive ability, and strove to increase the
growth, importance, and prosperity of Rensselaerwyck
in accordance with the Patroon
system. It has been said that he visited his
estate in the New Netherlands in 1637, but no
proof has been found and the report is discredited.
A distant landlord frequently is in ignorance, and
sometimes designedly kept so, of the actual state
of affairs in his estate, which would be remedied
if he were present. The Patroon was represented
in New Netherlands, when absent, by agents, partners,
or directors. Kiliaen admitted into a limited
partnership in his estate three prominent
members of the Amsterdam Chamber of the Dutch
West India Company, namely, Samuel Godyn,
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
Johannes de Laet, and Samuel Blommaert, in
order the sooner and more effectively to present
to the public the attractions of Rensselaerwyck,
and, presumably, also to abate the ill feeling
against him in the Netherlands for his having
taken advantage of his position to secure such an
immense estate. Van Rensselaer dominated that
partnership and again became sole proprietor.
Kiliaen died in 1646 and his son, Johannes, then
a minor, under the right of primogeniture, became
Patroon and continued to be until 1658, when he
died. His interests in Rensselaerwyck were cared
for at first by Van Slechtenhorst, or until 1652,
and then by the Patroon&rsquo;s half brother, Jan
Baptiste.</p>
<p>In 1658 Jeremias, the second son of Kiliaen,
became director and subsequently proprietor of
Rensselaerwyck and was the first of the Patroons
to reside in, or even visit, the estate in New
Netherlands.</p>
<p>There were eight of the Van Rensselaers called
Patroons, namely and in the order of primogeniture
except in the case of Jeremias:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">First.&mdash;Kiliaen, from 1629 to 1646.</p>
<p class="t0">Second.&mdash;Johannes, from 1646 to 1658.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p class="t0">Third.&mdash;Jeremias, from 1658 to 1674.</p>
<p class="t0">Fourth.&mdash;Kiliaen 2d, from 1674 to 1720.</p>
<p class="t0">Fifth.&mdash;Stephen, from 1720 to 1747.</p>
<p class="t0">Sixth.&mdash;Stephen 2d, from 1747 to 1769.</p>
<p class="t0">Seventh.&mdash;Stephen 3d, from 1769 to 1839.</p>
<p class="t0">Eighth.&mdash;Stephen 4th, from 1839 to 1868.</p>
</div>
<p>Under the Constitution and laws of the United
States in 1787 the Rensselaerwyck could no longer
be entailed and it was divided by Stephen 3d (the
seventh Patroon) between his sons Stephen 4th
(called Patroon merely by courtesy) and William
Patterson&mdash;the former getting the mansion, title,
and the estate in Albany, and the latter the estate
east of the Hudson.</p>
<p>During the Patroonship of the Van Rensselaers&mdash;a
period of about 150 years&mdash;many important
events occurred, changing the relations of nations,
the forms of government, and affecting Patroon
interests. The Patroons were reputable men of
affairs and some of them of superior abilities and
generally discharged their duties creditably. To
trace their acts through their rule would now be
not only tedious but useless. There arose a controversy
between the Dutch West India Company
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
and the Patroon concerning the territory surrounding
Fort Orange (in Albany) built by the
company, which was finally decided in favor of the
Patroon, as the territory surrounding the fort and
the fort itself was within his patent. The fur
trade early was very important and as the English,
claiming the territory under the right of
prior discovery, sought this trade, their vessels
sailed up the Hudson and set up trading posts.
The Patroon attempted to prevent traders from
coming to his colony to deal with the colonists and
Indians and with that object in view ordered one
Nicolaas Coorn to fortify Beeren Island (about
eleven miles below Albany), a commanding position,
and there demand of each skipper of a vessel
passing, except those of the Dutch West India
Company, a toll of five guilders ($2) as a tax and
also to lower his colors in honor of the Patroon.
Govert Loockermans, sailing the vessel &ldquo;Good
Hope&rdquo; up the river in 1644, was ordered, as he
was passing the fort, to lower her colors, which he
refused to do and Coorn gave him three cannon
shots. In pursuing this course the Patroon virtually
said, I own not only the territory on both sides
of the river but the river itself for that distance.
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
The Patroon was compelled to back down and pay
damages.</p>
<p>The Netherlands, an ancient kingdom, formerly
included Belgium (now a separate kingdom, Brussels,
its capital) and ten provinces besides North
and South Holland, its largest and most important
ones, with Amsterdam and The Hague as the
capitals. Frequently the name of Holland is used
when Netherlands should have been.</p>
<p>The Lords States General (in many respects
like our Congress, composed of the Senate and
House of Representatives) was the legislative
body of the Netherlands, and in June, 1621,
granted a charter to the Dutch West India Company,
giving it the exclusive privileges, for a
period of twenty-four years, as follows: To traffic
on the coast and in the interior of Africa from
the Tropic of Cancer to the Cape of Good Hope;
in America and the West Indies with the power
to make engagements, contracts, and alliances
with the rulers and people designated in the
charter; to build forts, to appoint and discharge
officers, to advance the settlement of unoccupied
territory, to enlarge the channels of commerce,
and to multiply the sources of revenue.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>The company was required to report, from time
to time, its doings, and in the appointment of civil
and military officers and instructions given to
them the Lords States General were to be consulted
and the commissions must bear their seal.
If troops were needed the Lords States General
would furnish them but the company must pay
all the expenses. The charter intrusted the government
of the company to five chambers of managers
consisting of nineteen members, eight from
the Amsterdam Chamber, four from the Zealand,
two from the Maas, two from North Holland, two
from the Frieland, and the government one.</p>
<p>This company, under its charter, introduced the
Patroon system granting certain rights and privileges
(very liberal ones and in some respects
extraordinary) and reserving the traffic in furs
and peltry and in manufactured goods and in the
carrying trade, except along the Atlantic coast, in
which the Patroons might engage, paying a fixed
tribute.</p>
<p>The colonists might, with the permission of the
Patroon and of the director of the Dutch West
India Company, take up what unoccupied land
they could work, paying an annual rent to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
Patroon. That rent was based upon the value of
land primarily and was to be paid in so many
bushels of wheat, rye, etc., so many pounds of
butter, so many eggs and so many chickens, etc.
Everything the colonists had to sell must first be
offered to the Patroon. The Dutch West India
Company was to furnish the Patroons troops if
needed as against the colonies, the expense to be
met by the landlords. The colonists couldn&rsquo;t
leave the Patroon&rsquo;s service during the term fixed.
The value of the land before cultivation and buildings
ranged usually from ten cents to two dollars
per acre. The tenant improved the land, built
house and barn to live comfortably, and what was
called &ldquo;the Quarter Sale&rdquo; seemed the most
unreasonable, intolerable. To illustrate: Suppose
the tenant occupied a farm originally valued
at $2 an acre for 200 acres, say $400. He had
improved it by cultivation, buildings, etc., until it
became worth and he sold it for $4,000. Then the
Patroon demanded $1,000. Four sales would give
the Patroon the whole. The rent, of course, was
paid annually, or should have been, and if there
were arrears the Patroon claimed that that must
come out of the remaining $3,000.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>The Netherlands primarily based their claim
for the territory called New Netherlands on Henry
Hudson&rsquo;s discovery (so called) of five degrees of
north latitude, viz.: from 40&deg; to 45&deg; or from Delaware
bay and river to Cape Cod, where he touched
or explored in 1609. Great Britain claimed under
the Cabots&rsquo; discoveries, in 1497 and 1498, the
whole stretch of the North Atlantic coast from
Florida to Newfoundland. The French claimed
a portion of northern Florida, which subsequently
became a part (the sea coast) of Georgia, and the
Spanish the rest of Florida. Virginia, under the
English, late in the sixteenth and early in the
seventeenth centuries, extended from Cape Fear
up to what later became the southern boundary
of Pennsylvania, and New England extended from
Virginia to Nova Scotia. From 1609 until 1664
the Dutch held the New Netherlands and then
were compelled to surrender the territory to the
English under the grant of Charles II to James,
his brother, the Duke of York and Albany, who, in
1685, became King of England under the title of
James III. Great Britain never recognized the
Dutch claim&mdash;always protested against it&mdash;but
being engaged in wars almost constantly did not
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
use force to obtain possession before. &ldquo;It had
become important to dislodge the Dutch to prevent
the smuggling of Virginia tobacco into England
at a loss to that government of some $50,000
in customs, and also to have an unbroken line of
English colonies from Florida to Nova Scotia.&rdquo;
The Dutch did not rely solely on Hudson&rsquo;s voyage
on the Hudson, but none of their claims had
validity and the colony of New Netherlands
passed under British rule and the Patroon took
the oath of allegiance to the English King, and
English laws instead of Dutch henceforth prevailed
in the colony.</p>
<p>As soon as the Patroons began to plant colonies
in New Netherlands the directors of the Amsterdam
Chamber of the Dutch West India Company
became jealous and opposed the Patroon system.
In 1634 they bought off the two Patroons, Samuel
Godyn and Samuel Blommaert (partners of
Kiliaen Van Rensselaer), who had secured a tract
on the shore of the Delaware bay making a territory
of sixty-four miles in circumference, and
also Michael Pauw, who had obtained Staten
Island, Jersey City, and Harsimus, with the lands
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
adjacent. An effort was made to buy off Patroon
Van Rensselaer, but he refused to sell.</p>
<p>While the New England colonies were rapidly
increasing in population and prosperity, the
New Netherlands was not. In 1647 the population
of the New Netherlands was only about 1,000
or 2,000 less than in 1643. A new policy was
ordered by the Lords States General so liberal
that settlers could buy as few acres as they wished
to and enjoy civil and religious freedom as did
the English colonies north and south of them.
Under the Patroon r&eacute;gime the Dutch colonists
had less freedom, the enjoyment of fewer rights,
and greater hardships to endure than in Holland.
They were, as they saw things, imposed upon and
serving masters who regarded them as slaves.</p>
<p>The gulf between the classes and the masses
seemed to widen and deepen&mdash;on one side, lords
and masters, and on the other side, subjects and
serfs. The Patroon family of the Van Rensselaers
by marriage and intermarriage were
related to the Van Cortlands, Schuylers, Livingstons,
and other wealthy families, not only in New
Netherlands but also in Virginia, and although
they had not castles, as the barons along the Rhine,
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
they had spacious mansions on their country
estates where they spent their summers and in
the winters went to Manhattan Island and in their
places there gave royal entertainments to the &eacute;lite.
They had a retinue of black servants (slaves) in
livery to attend them. The transplanting of the
feudal system, even though somewhat modified, to
the western world, where the very spirit of freedom,
liberty, and equality prevailed, was doomed
to failure and disaster. The principal cause was
in the system itself, though the Van Rensselaer
Patroons&rsquo; course hastened its abrogation, terminating
in blood. The most of the Van Rensselaer
Patroons were liberal, lenient, and indulgent, permitting
the rents to remain unpaid until they
amounted to a sum equal to, or in some cases
exceeding, the value of the leased land. It needed
not the wisdom of a prophet to predict trouble
from this course. When primogeniture was
abolished the eldest son was no longer the
inheritor of the estate, but all the children shared
in it. Stephen (3d) Van Rensselaer, the seventh
Patroon, born in 1764 and died in 1839, was in
fact the last of the Van Rensselaer Patroons. He
was graduated in Harvard in 1782, a doctor of
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
laws, the recipient of many and distinguished
civil and military honors, and a devoted patriot,
called &ldquo;the good old Patroon,&rdquo; as soon as the law
of primogeniture was abolished sought to dispose
of the most of the Rensselaerwyck estate (which
had been somewhat lessened by grants and sales)
under a peculiar form of deed or conveyance to
actual tillers of the soil. This title deed was
called by some &ldquo;a lease in fee&rdquo; and by others &ldquo;a
sale in fee,&rdquo; reserving to himself in the conveyances
and to his heirs and assigns all mines and
minerals and all streams of water for mill purposes;
and then certain old-time feudal returns,
denominated rents payable annually at the manor
house in Watervliet, such as a specified number
of bushels of good clean wheat, four fat fowls,
one day&rsquo;s service with carriages and horses, and
finally the one-quarter part of the purchase price
on every sale of land. The aim and intent was to
perpetuate, if possible, and as far as possible, the
interest of the Van Rensselaers in the estate.
The estate remaining was divided by the two
eldest sons, Stephen 4th getting that on the west
side and William Patterson Van Rensselaer that
on the east side of the Hudson river, and each all
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
the reservations of rents in their respective territories.
&ldquo;In 1839, when the said Stephen and
William Patterson began to push their claim
against the landholders and demand immediate
payment of back rents, etc., the landholders, called
&lsquo;anti-renters,&rsquo; held a convention and appointed
a committee to wait on Stephen Van Rensselaer
and ascertain if an amicable settlement of the
manor claims for rents in arrears could not be
made and to learn on what terms a clear and absolute
title to the land could be had. The committee,
men of character, went to the manor office
in 1839 to see and converse with Mr. Van Rensselaer,
but the latter refused to recognize or even
see the committee. He did, some time subsequently,
send a letter to the chairman of that committee
declining to sell on any terms. Great
excitement was created in Albany county. The
rent collectors were roughly treated and they were
told that no rents would be paid. Sheriffs were
called upon to discharge their duties and they
were resisted and driven back by men masked and
dressed in Indian costumes. The sheriff called to
aid him the &lsquo;posse comitatus,&rsquo; or power of the
county, and marched 600 strong into the anti-rent
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
district, where they were turned back by 1,500
anti-renters. The sheriff reported the state of
affairs to Governor William H. Seward, who
immediately ordered out eight companies of
militia under the command of Major Bloodgood.
They met no resistance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Patroon interest hoped the military
ordered out by the Governor of the State would
bring the anti-renters to their senses and induce
them to pay up. The landholders or anti-renters
hoped that their display of strength and resistance
would induce the Van Rensselaers to offer terms
of compromise which they could accept. Neither
hope was realized. Then some lawyer who had
dug into old English law books said the Patroon
patent was invalid and the matter must go to the
court for settlement. It became a political question
at once. The anti-renters elected representatives
in the Legislature from eleven counties and
the new Governor favored them. The decisions
of the courts seemed to alternate in favor of the
Van Rensselaers and then in favor of the anti-renters.
In 1852 the counsel of the Van Rensselaers
advised them to sell their claims, for they
believed they could not be sustained and that
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
advice was accepted. Some of the landholders or
anti-renters accepted the terms offered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then appeared Walter S. Church, who bought
the rest of the claims on speculation. He spared
no labor, no expense in any direction which he
thought might aid him. He magnificently entertained
legislators, lawyers, and judges. He was
indefatigable, exacting, demanding the utmost
farthing. Ejectment suits were brought and several
lives were sacrificed. The final decision was
against the Van Rensselaers, and thus ended a
long and bitter controversy growing out of the
Patroon system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who can estimate and properly accredit to the
different nations of Europe their just due in the
immigrants they sent to this country in its founding
and subsequently in building up the United
States as the greatest free republic on earth and
the hope of the liberty-loving world? The Dutch
must be among the early named with excellent
traits of character, and the Patroons deserve
credit for first colonizing them here.</p>
<p>We do not want to try to conjecture what the
results would have been if Hudson&rsquo;s exploration
of the North river had been in the interest of
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
France or if the Pilgrims had settled in 1620 in
the New Netherlands instead of New England.</p>
<p>Nearly 300 years have passed away since Henry
Hudson, in the yacht &ldquo;Half Moon,&rdquo; sailed over
the waters of the river bearing his name and
whose beauties he so greatly admired. That
majestic, noble river continues to flow on from the
mountains to the sea with a great unabated pure
stream in its primeval beauty and loveliness.
This statement must, however, be qualified, for
man&rsquo;s greed, cupidity, has caused him in some
localities to contaminate its waters and to mar
and to an extent destroy its matchless palisades.
Now that the governments have taken matters in
hand it is to be hoped that these abuses will be
summarily ended.</p>
<p>Art and architecture have embellished its banks
by lovely gardens, parterres and magnificent residences
and stately buildings. Attractive villages,
great and prosperous cities crown the Hudson
from the north and terminating in that unique,
wonderful, greatest, truly cosmopolitan city of
the world, New York. Nothing else did so much
to produce these results as Fulton&rsquo;s application
of steam to navigation and the opening up of a
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
through water transportation route from the
Atlantic to the Great lakes. Then the application
of steam as the motive power for railroads.
When the Hudson river is ice-bound the Hudson
River Railroad along its east bank and the West
Shore Railroad along its west bank transport
passengers and freight as they do the year around.
The Dutch possession of the New Netherlands was
short and when the English supplanted them
the Dutch names of places, very generally, were
changed to English ones. Manhattan island,
called by the Dutch &ldquo;New Amsterdam&rdquo; during
their rule, except from July, 1673, to October,
1674, when the Dutch recaptured and held the
&ldquo;New Netherlands&rdquo; and called it &ldquo;New
Orange,&rdquo; was changed to New York in honor of
the Duke of York and Albany, and has borne that
name ever since&mdash;a city of many millions of
inhabitants and billions of wealth, the site of
which was bought by and for the Dutch of the
Indians in 1626 for the sum of about twenty-four
dollars paid for in trinkets. Among many other
good things placed to the credit of the Dutch in
New Netherlands is the fact that the Dutch West
India Company established a good school in New
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
Amsterdam in 1633 which still flourishes under
the name of the &ldquo;School of the Collegiate
Reformed Church,&rdquo; which is the oldest institution
of learning in the United States, &ldquo;The Boston
Latin School,&rdquo; established in 1635, being the
second, and Harvard College, established in 1636,
the third.</p>
<p>The names of the site of Albany which, during
Dutch rule, were Rensselaerwyck and Beverwyck
(the latter including Fort Orange, built and maintained
by the Dutch West India Company, and the
land surrounding it, and the former the territory
outside of the fort and belonging to the Patroon)
were substituted by the name of Albany in honor
of the Duke of York and Albany, a name it has
borne ever since.</p>
<p>In 1783 the English colonies in North America
were recognized as free and independent and
formed the United States of America&mdash;the
colonies organizing State governments&mdash;but 100
years before this the colony of New York
demanded heaven-born rights and participation in
making the laws governing them as the colonists
of Virginia and Massachusetts had, and in the
General Assembly of the colony of New York, held
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
in Fort James in the city of New York October,
1683, put on record what they called the &ldquo;Charter
of Liberties and Privileges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ten original counties of the colony of New
York were Albany, Ulster, Dutchess, Orange,
Westchester, Richmond, Kings, Queens, Suffolk,
and New York, formed under Lieutenant-Governor
Thomas Dongan&rsquo;s administration, and
sent representatives to the General Assembly.
The boundaries of several of these counties have
not been materially changed, Albany county
embraced the whole territory lying north of Ulster
and west of the Hudson river, taking in nearly
the whole State. From its territory fifty of the
counties of the State have been erected and it has
appropriately been called &ldquo;the mother of the
counties of New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Albanians love their old Dutch city and will
cordially join in commemorating Henry Hudson&rsquo;s
advent to it nearly 300 years ago. Much has been
said in this article about the Patroon system and
the anti-renters, hoping to have these matters
better understood by a statement of facts. Concerning
affairs relating to Albany and vicinity, I
have frequently referred to, quoted and used

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
